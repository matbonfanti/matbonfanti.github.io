# three samples from my recent activity

For this portfolio, I have selected three the following three coding samples.

## 1. ambercalculator 

https://github.com/matbonfanti/ambercalculator

Since March 2009 I have been working in the group of Prof. M. Garavelli, University
of Bologna. In this context, been primarily responsible for the maintenance and development
of the Python code COBRAMM (https://site.unibo.it/cobramm), a tool that has been created
to realize spectroscopic simulations of photo-active systems in condensed phase (e.g.
molecules in solvent or pigments embedded in protein environments).

COBRAMM is a large project with a long history: my contribution 
is intertwined with the code from the people who have started and developed
the project before me. For this reason I have selected only a relatively
small excerpt, that I wrote from scratch and I think is representative
of my programming style. 

This code chunk, named *ambercalculator* is available from my GitLab repository:

    git clone https://github.com/matbonfanti/ambercalculator.git
    
 A more detailed description and instructions for installation and 
 testing are available in the README file.
 
## 2. mime

a small script in python called ''mime''
 
## 3. mime

the FORTRAN code ''sarastro''
